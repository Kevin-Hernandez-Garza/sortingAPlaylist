// This program asks the user to input 10 of their favorite songs along with the artists names
// then an algorithm sorts the playlist according to the artist name.
//  ******************************************************************

/*
You will write a program that allows the user to enter 10 songs and their artists into
a playlist and will sort the entries by artist order.  The program should use a 10 element
array of structure objects that holds two string variables:  artist and title.  Once the data
has been read in and stored, it should sort the entries in ascending order by artist.
It should then display the sorted array with appropriate headings.


Modularity:   The main function should create the Playlist object and call at least three other functions:


1.	Get the data from the user. Using a loop, have the user populate the playlist object array with
10 artist and songs in no particular order.   No validation is necessary.   However, you should use
the C++ getline function instead of cin so that the user can type spaces in the name and song title.


2.	Sort the list.  You may use either the bubble sort or the selection sort to sort your playlist.


3.	Display the list.  The function should display the artist and title in sorted order with appropriate headings.

Sample Output:
Playlist
Artist			Title
======================================
Cream			Sunshine of Your Love
Jimi Hendrix		All Along the Watchtower
Stevie Ray Vaughn	Texas Flood
ZZ Top			La Grange
